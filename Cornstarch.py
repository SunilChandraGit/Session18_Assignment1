The population mean is 100.

µ= 100

Let us assume significance level as 5% (0.05).

Random chance probability using z score and z-table.

z= (108-100) / (15/Math.sqrt(36))

z = 3.20

Looking at z-table and p-value associated with 3.20 is 0.9993 i.e. probability of having value less than 108 is 0.9993 and 
more than or equals to 108 is (1-0.9993)=0.0007.

It is less than 0.05 so we will reject the Null hypothesis i.e. there is raw cornstarch effect.
